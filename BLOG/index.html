<h3 id="BEG">The Begining</h3>
<p>At first it was really confusing. All the CSS and http and stuff, it was so new to me.<br>
I missed 2 days of class because i was in Miami, and my mom got the days that me and my brothers got in wrong.<br>
 The first days were confusing, but i got it after a while.

<h3 id="CLASS">Through The Class</h3>
<p>
When i first learned about binary, i aleady knew what the basics were, but i never knew that things would get that complicated <br>
i was talking with jose the second double block, and the teacher took me out, and i had trouble catching up after that<br>
